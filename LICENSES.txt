All of the following licenses apply to this software. Usage and modification
requires consent with these.

==================================================
  (1) Terms to arrange proper privacy compliance
==================================================

Modification of this text in this section is not allowed. If you do not use the
privacy policy provided in your derivative work, this section (1) can be removed
from it, else it can't.

The words "I", "me", "my", "we", "our", "us" refer to Vincent Kuhlmann.

"Software", "this software", "the software" or plainly "software" refers to the
software provided in the repository of Minecraft Proximity Chat, available here
as
https://github.com/vkuhlmann/minecraft-proximity

Next, "Modified version" refers to a derivative of the Software which is
different to all versions provided on the stated repository. This is with the
exception that changes involving only Python scripts are not considered modified
versions, if the distributor adheres to the following conditions:
  (a) The distributor warrants the privacy side of the Python-part of Modified
      version.
  (b) The distributor must state there is a modification upon distribution. Or
      this must be evident from the context, like talking about you having
	  modified the script, and sending a Python script soon after.
  (c) The distributor cannot collect any personal data through the modified
      script.
If there is no actual distributor involved, i.e. you are the author, then you
are considered as the distributor in these conditions.

If sending a Python script made for use with the Software, even when not based
on a Python script of the Software, this is considered distributing a derivative
of the Software, since it implies an altering of the Software.

The privacy policy provided is valid for any derivative of the Software which
is not a Modified version.

For a Modified version, the provided privacy policy is void. Furthermore, you
should change the client ID by your own before use. This involves registering a
new application through Discord:
https://discord.com/developers/applications

I hereby grant you an MIT license to copy the privacy policy, with the
overruling that you don't need to include the copyright notice, nor the
permission notice. You can hence simply swap out my name and e-mailaddress by
yours. Of course, update the text if your applications requires more liberties.
