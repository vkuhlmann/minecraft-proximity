  Minecraft Proximity Chat Privacy Policy
===========================================

The purpose of this software is to provide a proximity chat integration in
Discord based on screen-read coordinates of a Minecraft client. Any data
collected is exclusively done so in the context of providing this service.

This privacy policy is represented by Vincent Kuhlmann, reachable via
vincent [dot] kuhlmann [at] hotmail [dot] com. This program doesn't really
collect any personal information, however the Discord Terms of Service require
me to provide a Privacy Policy anyway.

The words "I", "me", "my", "we", "our", "us" refer to Vincent Kuhlmann.
"Software", "this software", "the software" or plainly "software" refers to the
software provided in the reposity of Minecraft Proximity Chat, available here
as

1. What data do we collect?
---------------------------

The Software integrates with certain Discord API's. Consequently, using the
Software can invoke Discord collecting data, as already accepted by Discord
users, and outlined in Discord's privacy policy, e.g. accessable via
https://discord.com/privacy.

I do not collect any data from you.

================================================================================

If you are interested in how the Software collects and uses any information
(again, not involving me), read on:

The following data can be used by the Software:
(1) Username and user customization you provided.
    - Stored only locally, and can be communicated through Discord API's as your
	  profile status and to people who participate in an Discord activity
	  associated with the Software.

(2) Configuration data you provided.
	- Stored only locally, and can be communicated through Discord API's as your
	  profile status and to people who participate in an Discord activity
	  associated with the Software.

(3) Discord profile information
    - Stored only locally, and can be communicated through Discord API's as your
	  profile status and to people who participate in an Discord activity
	  associated with the Software.
	
(4) Screen captures
    - Immediately discarded after being processed, which is usually within a
	  second of it being taken.
	- The capture is used for the sole purpose of obtaining Minecraft
	  coordinates, or any other information displayed on the Minecraft client
	  relevant to providing the service.
	- The extracted data as described in the point above can be communicated
	  through Discord API's to people who who participate in an Discord activity
	  associated with the Software.

(5) Voice
	- The Software can with or without notice, order Discord to connect voice,
	  which means other members of the activity might hear you, and you might
	  hear them.
	- Beware: the global mute setting in Discord might not work for muting.
	  Please use the feature in the Software to bring up the voice settings
	  overlay, in which you can change your audio settings.
	- The Software can't and doesn't access any audio transmitted through
	  Discord.
	  
(6) Voice speaking/non-speaking events
	- The Discord API can provide binary speaking/non-speaking events for users,
	  regarding audio connected through the activity. 
	- Only kept for the runtime duration.
	



The Software can store data locally, and sent it 

[Information you provide.] The Software collects any username, and user
customization you provided. The Software also collects configuration data you
provide.

[Data we collect automatically.] The Software can use the following data
automatically
* Discord profile information
* Screen captures
* Speak/no speak events as provided by the Discord API

2. How will we use your data?
-----------------------------



As to the Software itself, for release versions, no personal data is kept
beyond runtime. The Software might store configuration, telemetry and debug
information beyond runtime however. Any data stored, whether for this latter
sentence, or concerning personal data in non-release versions, is stored only
on the computer running the program, and/or though any Discord service.

Additionally, the Software uses networking through Discord API's to provide
its services. The information sent through only includes information directly
relevant to the gameplay (like player coordinates and player status), in
addition to any public (or known to the recepient) information. The latter
can include any form of username or user id.

For the duration of the runtime, the program requires certain data:
* The Software can order Discord API's to connect voice, whether upon request
  and/or notice, or automatically. The Software may use Discord API provided
  events about when someone is speaking. However, it has no access to the actual
  transmitted voice.
  
* The Software 

* The Software can invoke Python scripts for providing of its service. This can
  include, but is not limited to a script reading Minecraft coordinates of the
  screen and performing the volume logic. If you modify these scripts, then for
  any distribution, you must, to any reasonable extent, clarify collection and
  usage of any personal information.

At runtime, the program may invoke screen capture methods for the sole purpose
of obtaining Minecraft coordinates. These captures are immediately discarded
after use, which is usually within a second of it being taken.
